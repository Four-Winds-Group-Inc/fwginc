        <p>Four Winds Group doesn't focus all our resources on M-PET, we can create custom, made-to-order applications as well. Maybe you want a website that you can use from multiple workstations to access information on a central database. We can do that. Maybe you want an application on a smartphone or tablet that you can use out in the field, we can do that, too. Whatever software you require, Four Winds Group can deliver it.</p>

        <p>If you have an existing system in place that you can't change but you'd like to use M-PET, let our IT staff come up with a plan. We will create a custom interface to import the information from your existing systems into M-PET where subsequent actions will take place. This allows you to continue using your legacy systems while taking advantage of M-PET's great features and benefits.</p>
