          <span>Beginnings</span>
          <p>In the mid 1980s Four Winds Enterprises, a large privately owned transportation company based in San Diego, California, was experiencing the pains of successful expansion of their core business. A growing fleet of equipment, scattered all around the world needed systematic management of maintenance records to meet safety, regulation and budget mandates.</p>
          <p>Four Winds - known for their technical savvy, innovation and willingness to purchase the best tools to run their business became one of the first companies in San Diego to purchase the newest generation of IBM 'Super Mini' - the System 38. This System had an advanced architecture and relational database that revolutionized data handling. Following this, Four Winds found the best available Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) available on the previous IBM generation of mini-computer and worked to develop a new and more powerful version for their use on the new System 38, the 'MainTracker'. Four Winds Enterprises created another company called Four Winds Systems, whose primary function was to develop sales and support to distribute the new system to a fast growing industry that embraced the System 38 and the subsequent IBM AS/400.</p></div>

          <span>Transitions</span>
          <p>In 1989, Four Winds Group, Inc (FWG) formed. At the time, with the smaller PC and PC server technology becoming the niche computers of choice, FWG found a company on the east coast that offered
        PC based maintenance management software of the USA and was now able to provide a Disk Operating System (DOS) based maintenance management solution. This company's products went from DOS to the first generation Windows and finally to the Windows 95 based application environment, the product being called, 'MPET'. In 2005 FWG was able to purchase the software business in order to offer more flexibility to our growing list of clients. Afterwards, an intense effort commenced to create a new product under the .NET development environment. After two years, M-PET.NET 1.0.0.0 was delivered. This platform is continually being improved and enhanced to ensure it is delivering the promised maintenance management information. With a desktop and web application available, M-PET.NET offers capabilities and functions not duplicated nor available from other companies in this competitive marketplace. Development based on customer feedback, needs, and technological advancements, will ensure that M-PET.NET will continue to grow. Our focus on constumer satisfaction will ensure your system will remain both relevant and current.</p></div>
