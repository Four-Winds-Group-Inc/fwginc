Front-end application refactor.

#### To run frontend application

In your terminal:
- cd into your frontend directory
- npm install -g parcel-bundler (we are currently using Parcel as our no configuration bundler rather than webpack)
- npm i (on level of your package.json)
- npm start
- Your application should now be running on http://localhost:1234 (unless otherwise directed)
