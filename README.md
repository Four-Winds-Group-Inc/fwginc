## Four Winds Group

Front-end application refactor.

#### To run frontend application

In your terminal:
- cd into your frontend directory
- npm install -g parcel-bundler (we are currently using Parcel as our no configuration bundler rather than webpack)
- npm i (on level of your package.json)
- npm start
- Your application should now be running on http://localhost:1234

#### Progress notes as of Tuesday, August 14th, 2018

- Working on basic scaffolding of components.
- Browser router not implemented currently, application will build but no views have been linked to App component.
- Currently editing content for the purpose of readability as well as typos.
